Volunteer travel is a great way to give returning while finding the world, assuming you go with an established organization. But packing could be intimidating. Some courses give you a advised packing list, however, not all. I’ve today volunteered twice in Thailand, incorporating once at the Elephant Characteristics Park, and also on jobs in the Dominican Republic. So whether or not you’re heading on a two-year dedication with the Peace Corps or a week long objective trip, I’m offering information on packing for volunteer excursions.

What is the purpose of your trip?
Obviously you’re there to volunteer, but which kind of volunteering? Could it be a objective trip where you’ll have to gown conservatively? Are you dealing with children or outside? Will you be near retailers if you want to get something you forgot? Also consider how much leisure time you’ll have, which can determine what clothing and equipment you bring.

How much time are you journeying for?
If you’re only traveling for a week roughly, I wouldn’t spend many money on clothing for volunteering. In my experience, these clothing items are certain to get totally trashed on certain journeys. For my history volunteer trips, I mostly wore old t-shirts and leggings and threw some aside afterwards. I under no circumstances could easily get the stain from the banana trees we chop out of 1 of my shirts, actually after multiple washes, therefore i finished up donating it.

Also understand that you can purchase extra items if you want them when you reach your destinations. Shop at local marketplaces for replacement items, that will also help you blend in. In the event that you don’t have any clothes in the home that you’re ready to part with, check out your local thrift store to get essentials. Then you can certainly donate again afterwards.

Fundamental Items for a Volunteer Trip
1. 3-4 comfy t-t shirts, either cotton or moisture wicking
2. 1-2 tank tops, based on weather
3. yoga pants (just like my Pins to Kill!) or other comfortable bottoms
4. shorts or perhaps capris for warm weather
5. sturdy sneakers
6. bandana or headband like a Buff
7. hat to go over your ears
8. laundry bag to keep filthy items separate
9. Wet Wipes (Epic Wipes are perfect for these trips!)
10. mosquito repellent
11. One or two outfits for time off
