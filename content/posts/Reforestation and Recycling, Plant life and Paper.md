Most of us have trees for granted. There happen to be oak trees over 100 years old near my house and my hometown is one of the greenest, literally not eco-friendly, cities in america. They mean clean air and shade to safeguard us from the damaging sun together with safeguard from landslides. They’re something to climb and play on as kids. Quite often the trees wreak havoc, especially during tornadoes, but otherwise, we’re happy to have them.

I’ve been to places where in fact the logging industry has already established their approach with the property, as close as my grandmother’s house on North Georgia to as a long way away as Thailand. Where trees applied to be, there’s bit more than dirt and twigs. It includes a major environmental impact on the creatures that phone these areas residence. There’s also the situation of waste, which ends up in landfills when not recyclable.

Reforestation and Planting Trees
My time with Fathom in the Dominican Republic addressed both of these problems separately. On my 1st day of impact actions, I went to a community outside Puerto Plata to focus on a reforestation job. Each day there differs, and the group gets results in lots of different locations, but upon this day we caused IDDI to find out seedlings from the hillside and transplant them in to the greenhouse.

I was ready to get my hands dirty, literally and figuratively, and was handed a set of mismatched gloves. We had been adopted the hill where we had been shown how to find the right seedlings, positioned in no particular buy, and dig them up carefully to safeguard the seed. There weren’t enough shovels, so I dug with my hands until my fingertips were throbbing. A guy came up if you ask me and confirmed me how to do it with a stay.

Erosion is a large problem here, especially because of the sudden rainstorms we experienced firsthand that evening, so these little seedlings would assist in preventing it. During the period of a couple of hours, we planted over 400 of what would turn into palm, mangrove, and sea grape trees. Locals might 1 day remain under these trees with a frigid drink or they might turn into paper that schoolchildren figure out how to write on.

Recycling and Making Paper
After my own day of planting trees and seeing the massive landfill on the ride into town, I got eventually to see firsthand the impact of waste. An usually beautiful plot of land was first the website of littering but soon persons heard about it and continuing dumping here until bits of white were whatever you observed among the green setting. It’s a thing that could just as quickly happen where most of us live with out a way to recycle.

IDDI recognized the issue within their communities and started a two-step process to fight it. Primary, they partnered with native businesses to collect their docs and papers for shredding. This can help both businesses that don’t need to purchase shredding services for their sensitive legal documents aswell as for the people who can recycle the paper instead of having it conclude in a landfill like the one I saw.

Making paper
From there, the females of Repapel, a women’s cooperative, shred the paper and type it into blank and inked. It’s soaked in a washer and prepared in a blender to be pulp. From there, they use strainers to draw the liquids out and contact form the paper. It’s hung to dry, quickly in the Dominican sun, and pressed to be purchased as paper. This allows the ladies to earn a modest money to support their children, some with special needs, while reusing items that would otherwise be disposed of.

But this is merely taking care of of what Repapel will. Other projects they focus on involve candlemaking and charms making, employing seeds and coffees. I wasn’t sure we had been in fact helping until they informed us that we created 152 bits of paper within a afternoon! That’s various fewer bits of paper in landfills. It manufactured me feel that perhaps just one person, or group, can make a notable difference.
